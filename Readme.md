The Remington #2 was the first typewriter with "macros" - it could type lowercase or uppercase based on whether the user was holding a key they called Shift. This modern, battery powered keyboard is much smaller and more portable than that original typewriter, but it lost a key. Since this layout is missing the right Shift, it's a version before the Remington #2 - the Remington #1.1

MVP is battery-powered custom 65% keyboard with full-sized arrow keys.
