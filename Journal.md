#### 7_3_2025 Design key layout

*1.2h* I want this to be a very small, bluetooth enabled, battery powered keyboard. I like the Drop Alt board design, so I'm aiming for something like that.

Getting full arrow keys (where the up/down keys aren't .5u tall) wreaks havoc with spacing. I got rid of the right shift key. 

Having func keys tertiary to the num row is fine, but I want a completely seperate esc and del key, so dropped those on the right near the arrow keys. In a final version those might just be macros.

#### 7_15_2025 Schematic + PCB V1

*1h* Started this by laying out the switches and diodes on the schematic. I layed them out in a 14 x 5 grid, then deleted switches from the rows with fewer keys: ![Schematic Version 1](assets/Schematic_V1.png)

*1.5h* Once I figured out how to move the symbols on the right grid (drag them from the center pad), moving these around was pretty easy. Unfortunately I turned off the ratnest, and when I turned it back on realized the numbering was off. KiCad numbered my switches oddly when I copied and pasted on the schematic, so the last three rows of keys are all messed up. Problem for next time. ![PCB Version 1 ](assets/PCB_V1.png)
